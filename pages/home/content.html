            Porsche started as an automotive engineering company in Stuttgart, Germany. Its founder, Ferdinand Porsche, a brilliant German engineer, initially designed cars for other brands like Volkswagen. However, after establishing his own company, he successfully created cars with distinctive features that quickly gained attention, not only in Germany but worldwide.
            The first Porsche model, the 356, hit the market in 1948 and rapidly gained popularity. With its unique design and lightweight engine, it set the foundation for Porsche’s design philosophy. From then on, Porsche has continued producing vehicles that combine exceptional design and performance.
